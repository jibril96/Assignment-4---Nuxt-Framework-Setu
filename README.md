### Assignment 4 - Nuxt Framework Setup

## Jibril

# Code Journal 

* For Nuxt setup, I just set up Nuxt using `npx create-nuxt-app NuxtSetup`.

* Then i installed dependencies using `$ npm install`.

* I built for production and launch server using `$ npm run build` and `$ npm run start`

* Setting up Nuxt was easier because i just followed the step-by-step web instructions on [Nuxtjs.org](https:/gi/nuxtjs.org/docs/get-started/installation/)

* I added tailwind, storyblok, image, and anime.

* Mostly i just followed steps on the site to add and setup modules.

* I got to give Fesal credit for assisting me with storyblok, and couple instructions to add modules.

* My struggle with this assignment was not being sure i added the modules correctly at first unit things were cleared.
